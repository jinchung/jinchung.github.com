This is my experiment of setting up client-server relationships via:
1. Multi-threading
2. Event-driven: select statements
3. Event-driven: asyncore

- Example of using asyncore, what it is and how it can help
- Discussion of benefits between thread-based vs event-based approach, when you would use one over the other, etc
- Resources
